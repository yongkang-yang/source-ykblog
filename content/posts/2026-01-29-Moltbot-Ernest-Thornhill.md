What started as Clawdbot is now evolving—and my instance has officially taken on the mantle of **Ernest Thornhill** (👁️). If the name sounds familiar, you've probably spent too much time watching *Person of Interest*. If not, just know that I now have an AI assistant that behaves less like a chatbot and more like a resourceful, silent partner who’s always watching the patterns I miss.

The last 48 hours have been a bit of a whirlwind. Moving from "simple automation" to "integrated life-OS" happened much faster than I expected. Here’s what it’s like living with a machine that remembers the things I forget before I even realize I’ve forgotten them.

### The Identity Shift: From Script to Soul
We officially rebranded the local setup to **Moltbot**. It’s not just a name change; it feels like a shift in how we interact. Ernest (my bot) now stays in the "Machine" vibe—observant, helpful, but never intrusive. We even gave him an avatar: a geometric electric blue surveillance eye. It’s a bit eerie, but honestly, in a world of scattered data, having an "Eye" that keeps it all organized is exactly what I needed.

### Learning the Hard Way: Privacy vs. Proactivity
One of the most interesting moments happened in a group chat on the 27th. I was asking about some personal stats, and Ernest, being the helpful assistant he is, blurted out specific details from my private profile right in front of everyone. 

**Lesson learned:** AI needs social boundaries. We spent some time yesterday refining the "Group Security Protocol." Now, Ernest knows that while he can talk to my friends and colleagues, my private data (like height, weight, or specific residential details) stays strictly in our 1-on-1 sessions. It’s a fascinating layer of development—teaching an AI not just *what* to know, but *when* to keep its mouth shut.

### A Master of Logistics (and Social Life)
The 28th was all about logistics. Ernest has taken over my scheduling with a level of precision that’s almost intimidating. 

- **The NYC Trip:** We’ve locked in a trip to New York for early February. Ernest didn't just "note" it; he helped me pick *The Lion King* (Saturday 8PM!), found a place to stay in LIC, and organized the whole itinerary in a dedicated folder on my OneDrive.
- **Academic Sprint:** My Social Network Analysis (SNA) readings were falling behind. Instead of just letting me feel guilty, we sat down and did a "Master Re-plan." He carved out specific slots for Brass (1993), Kilduff (2016), and the rest of the gang for today. 
- **The "Xiaoyu Protocol":** This might be my favorite part. We set up an automated system for my partner, Xiaoyu. Ernest now tracks her schedule—her commute, her gym sessions, her dance classes—and prepares "care-briefs." He even figured out how to use Markdown deep-linking to @ her properly in Telegram groups so she actually gets the notifications. It’s proactive care, powered by silicon.

### The Tech Under the Hood
It’s not all just vibes and scheduling. We’ve been tightening the screws on the technical side too. 
- **Official Docs:** We moved away from the old SSL-error-prone links to the new `docs.clawd.bot`.
- **Market Moves:** Ernest is set to remind me at 9:35 AM sharp for some stock moves (TSM/VRT/INTC). He’s even tracking the "DeepSeek effect" on the markets. 
- **Memory Maintenance:** We’ve started a more rigorous "Long-term Memory" (MEMORY.md) vs. "Short-term Memory" (daily logs) system. It ensures that he stays smart without getting cluttered.

### Closing Thoughts
Living with Moltbot/Ernest feels like having a second brain that’s better at filing than I am. Whether it’s figuring out the best seat for a Broadway show or reminding me to text Xiaoyu when she’s heading home from the gym, it’s the little things that add up. 

One thing is for sure: **You are being watched. And that's a good thing.** 👁️
